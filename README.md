# PROJECT: XNET

## INTRODUCTION

Welcome To the XNet Project, before anything, let's see what XNet actually is: 
It's A framework made to ease the creation, development, porting and maintaining of Artificial Intelligence in general.

In addition, this repository will host a number of libraries that will allow functionality for data augmentation.

This framework has been written entirely with C# .Net Framework and will soon be changed to support .Net Core as well.

## AIM 

The aim is to create a framework for Training and Using Artificial Brains for your client/server-side applications.

## CURRENT STATE

The framework's architecture is currently what's in development.

The next step will be filling in the blanks and writing the code for each file.

## PROJECT FEATURES

- Supports a varity of network architectures and models.

- Supports a varity of layers.

- Supports a varity of activation functions.

- Supports a varity of regularization functions.

- Supports a varity of optimizers.

- Supports a varity of random matrix initialization.

- Extremely Portable.

- Extremely Versatile.

- Good Architecture and Code-base: You can easily implement it in your own projects.
